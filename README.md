# Grindcast

## Grindcast mod for Wurm
This mod is a quality of life improvement for enchanting. Whenever a cast is performed and not enough favor is available, it will automatically sacrifice items from the inventory and open containers in order to refill favors.

## How to install
Firstly, it requires [Ago's client modloader](https://github.com/ago1024/WurmClientModLauncher/releases/). You can then download the file grindcast.zip and extract its contents inside the **WurmLauncher/mods** folder.

## How does it work
For it to work properly, you need to have the inventory/inventories containing the sacrificables, as well as the altar, open. The items to sacrifice, and the amount of favor they grant, are specified in the configuration file (grindcast.PROPERTIES).
With this setup, just cast the spells as usual. Whenever you don't have enough favor to cast the spell, the right amount of items will be sacrificed instead, refilling your favor to maximum.
